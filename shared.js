// Helpers shared by the engine (deck.html) and the launcher (index.html).
//
// Why this file exists (2026-08-17): index.html deliberately never loads a
// deck's engine or content -- "the launcher stays a reader" (PHASE2_PLAN.md
// §2.2) -- so it used to carry its own copy of every one of these. Copies
// drift silently: nothing fails, the two screens just quietly begin
// disagreeing, which is exactly the class of bug the stats audit that
// prompted this file spent its time chasing. A test guard was written first
// and did catch simulated drift, but a guard only tells you the copies have
// diverged; this removes the copies.
//
// Rules for anything living here:
//   * Pure. No DOM, no S, no globals from either page. Everything a function
//     needs arrives as an argument -- which is why heatRec/heatCellBg take
//     `days` and `mode`/`accent` rather than reading S.days/S.settings the
//     way the engine's own versions once did.
//   * Declared with plain top-level const/function. Classic scripts share
//     one global lexical scope, so these names are visible to any <script>
//     that loads after this one -- and NEITHER page may redeclare them, or
//     the later declaration is a hard SyntaxError.
//
// Loaded as an ordinary parser-blocking <script src> before each page's own
// script, alongside decks/registry.js. It must also be copied by
// tools/make_upload_bundle.sh: a generator script that predates a newly
// required file has already shipped one fully broken deploy in this project.

// Retention's ramp is mixed in OKLCH, not sRGB (2026.08.15.6). Blending
// --good into --again through sRGB walks a straight line in a space where
// that line passes through desaturated mud: the midpoint of a green and a
// red is a murky brown, and two adjacent days at genuinely different recall
// could read as "murky green" and "lush green" with no way to tell which was
// the better one. OKLCH takes the shorter hue path instead, which for
// green -> red descends through yellow and orange -- the familiar
// traffic-light ramp, monotonic to the eye at every step, and the reason the
// legend gradient in deck.html can be read as a scale at all. Volume keeps
// its single-hue accent-into-panel ramp, which was already monotonic; it is
// mixed in OKLCH too purely so the legend and the cells agree exactly.

// ---- device-created decks (Phase 4, PHASE3_4_HANDOFF.md §2) ----
// decks/registry.js stays the static seed list (its own header comment: "an
// IndexedDB-backed registry only earns its keep once a deck can be *created*
// on the device, at which point this file becomes the seed for that store
// rather than something to rewrite" -- that point is now). A deck created by
// the triage screen adds a row here instead: same shape as a REGISTRY row
// (id/key/title/script/words/blurb/archived), source:'idb' always set, kept
// in localStorage rather than IndexedDB because deck.html's own ?deck=
// lookup runs synchronously in the head, before any IndexedDB open is even
// possible (see that boot script's own comment on why it must stay
// synchronous) -- same "small localStorage mirror of something IndexedDB-
// backed" shape BOOT_KEY already uses for the theme. Device-local only:
// discovering that a deck EXISTS does not sync between devices in this
// build (the deck's own state/log, once created, syncs like any other deck
// once a code is entered for it -- only the "here is a deck" fact stays
// local). Read via a tiny JSON.parse(localStorage...) directly in each page
// rather than a shared loader function, on purpose -- see this file's own
// purity rule above; only the merge logic (where a real bug could hide) is
// pure enough to live here.
const USER_DECKS_KEY='vocabula.userDecks';
// A user deck can never share an id with a built-in one (minted ids are
// 'd'+base36, disjoint from the short static ids in decks/registry.js) but

// shape this app is actually used in -- that was measured at 35 shown
// against 105 painted, so a day the chip called average rendered at a fifth
// of the fill. The legend says "against your own average"; this makes that
// sentence true of the number actually on screen.

// off, with the picker on 'week') averages zero, and a zero baseline paints

// one palette and violet in another -- worse under daily rotation, which
// hands you a new scale each morning. Retention now reads --heat-good/
// --heat-again (palettes.css), fixed pairs, one per mode, not per palette --
// a day means the same colour every day. Volume's FAR end (the accent) is
